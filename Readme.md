# React Components Catalog

Inspired by the [awesome-react-components](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components) but lists only the components I use myself and can recommend. I believe 15 date picker components for React can’t be awesome and you still have no idea which one you should use.


## UI Components

### Component Libraries

- [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) — great project but the CSS is from original Bootstrap, so never use in a project with custom design.
- [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) — a set of React Components that Implement Google's Material Design
- [semantic-ui-react](http://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) — Semantic is a framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts

### Select

- [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) — filtering, multiple selection, etc.

### Date/time Picker

- [react-day-picker](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker) - flexible date picker.

### Autocomplete

- [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) — WAI-ARIA compliant.

### Autosize Textarea

- [react-textarea-autosize](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-textarea-autosize) - replacement for the textarea element which automatically resizes textarea as content changes.

### Masked Input

- [react-input-mask](https://github.com/sanniassin/react-input-mask) - input masking with attention to small usability details with cursor position, copy-paste, etc.

### Rich Text Editing

- [react-codemirror](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-codemirror) — CodeMirror component.

### Tables

- [Reactabular](http://reactabular.js.org/) — very flexible framework to work with tables.

### Miscellaneous

- [react-pagify](https://github.com/bebraw/react-pagify) — very flexible but simple pagination, has a [Bootstrap skin](https://github.com/sapegin/react-pagify-preset-bootstrap).
- [markdown-to-react-components](https://github.com/christianalfoni/markdown-to-react-components) — Markdown rendering. Generates real React components instead of HTML string, based on `marked`, do not require additional webpack configuration (e.g. `json-loader` required by [markdown-react-js](https://github.com/alexkuz/markdown-react-js) and [remark-react](https://github.com/mapbox/remark-react)).
- [react-sortable-tree](https://github.com/fritz-c/react-sortable-tree) — drag-and-drop sortable component for nested data and hierarchies.
- [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) — React based Presentation Library
